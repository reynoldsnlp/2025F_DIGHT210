    <h1>Lesson 1c: Variables - Storing Information for Later Use</h1>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Think of variables as labeled boxes where you can store information. Once you put something in a box (assign a value), you can use that information anywhere in your program. Variables are one of the most fundamental concepts in programming!</p>
        <p>In this lesson, you'll learn:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How to create variables and assign values to them</li>
            <li>Rules for naming variables</li>
            <li>Different types of data you can store</li>
            <li>How to change variable values</li>
            <li>Common mistakes and how to avoid them</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Creating Your First Variables</h2>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Creating a variable is simple: you choose a name and assign a value using the equals sign (<code>=</code>).</p>
        <p>The pattern is: <strong>variable_name = value</strong></p>
        <p>The equals sign doesn't mean "equal to" in math - it means "assign this value to this variable."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-pdb">
        <pre><code># Creating variables with different types of information
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 5.6
is_student = True

# Using variables in print statements
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height, "feet")
print("Is student:", is_student)</code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Notice how we can store different types of information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Text (strings):</strong> "Alice" - surrounded by quotes</li>
            <li><strong>Whole numbers (integers):</strong> 25 - no quotes</li>
            <li><strong>Decimal numbers (floats):</strong> 5.6 - no quotes</li>
            <li><strong>True/False values (booleans):</strong> True or False - no quotes, capital letters</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Exercise: Create Personal Information Variables</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Create variables to store information about yourself or a fictional character. Include a name, age, and favorite color.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-exercise"
         data-expected-output="Name: Bob
Age: 30
Favorite color: blue"
         data-answer='name = "Bob"
age = 30
favorite_color = "blue"
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Favorite color:", favorite_color)'>
# TODO: Create a variable called name and assign it a string value
# TODO: Create a variable called age and assign it a number
# TODO: Create a variable called favorite_color and assign it a string
# TODO: Print each variable with a descriptive label
    </div>

    <h2>2. Rules for Variable Names</h2>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Python has specific rules for variable names. Following these rules prevents errors and makes your code easier to read:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Must start with a letter or underscore:</strong> <code>name</code>, <code>_private</code></li>
            <li><strong>Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores:</strong> <code>user_name2</code>, <code>total_cost</code></li>
            <li><strong>Cannot start with a number:</strong> <code>2names</code> is invalid</li>
            <li><strong>Cannot contain spaces:</strong> Use underscores instead</li>
            <li><strong>Case sensitive:</strong> <code>Name</code> and <code>name</code> are different variables</li>
            <li><strong>Cannot use Python keywords:</strong> <code>print</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, etc.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-pdb">
        <pre><code># Good variable names
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Smith"
user_age = 28
total_score = 95
is_valid = True

# Demonstrating case sensitivity
name = "lowercase"
Name = "Capitalized"
NAME = "UPPERCASE"

print("name:", name)
print("Name:", Name)
print("NAME:", NAME)

# Good practice: descriptive names
student_count = 25
average_temperature = 72.5
book_title = "Python Programming"

print("Students:", student_count)
print("Temperature:", average_temperature)
print("Book:", book_title)</code></pre>
    </div>

    <h3>Exercise: Practice Good Variable Names</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Create variables with descriptive names for a recipe. Include the recipe name, number of servings, and cooking time in minutes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-exercise"
         data-expected-output="Recipe: Chocolate Chip Cookies
Servings: 24
Cooking time: 12 minutes"
         data-answer='recipe_name = "Chocolate Chip Cookies"
number_of_servings = 24
cooking_time_minutes = 12
print("Recipe:", recipe_name)
print("Servings:", number_of_servings)
print("Cooking time:", cooking_time_minutes, "minutes")'>
# TODO: Create a variable for recipe name (use descriptive variable name)
# TODO: Create a variable for number of servings
# TODO: Create a variable for cooking time in minutes
# TODO: Print all three with appropriate labels
    </div>

    <h2>3. Changing Variable Values</h2>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Variables are called "variables" because their values can vary (change)! You can assign new values to existing variables at any time. The old value is forgotten and replaced with the new one.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-pdb">
        <pre><code># Starting with an initial value
score = 10
print("Initial score:", score)

# Changing the value
score = 15
print("Updated score:", score)

# Changing to a completely different value
score = 100
print("Final score:", score)

# You can even change the type of data
message = "Hello"
print("Message as text:", message)

message = 42
print("Message as number:", message)

message = True
print("Message as boolean:", message)</code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Notice that Python doesn't complain when we change the type of data stored in a variable. This flexibility makes Python easy to use, but be careful not to accidentally change types when you don't mean to!</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Exercise: Track Changing Values</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Create a variable for a player's health in a game. Start with 100, then reduce it to 75, then increase it back to 90, printing the value each time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-exercise"
         data-expected-output="Starting health: 100
After damage: 75
After healing: 90"
         data-answer='player_health = 100
print("Starting health:", player_health)

player_health = 75
print("After damage:", player_health)

player_health = 90
print("After healing:", player_health)'>
# TODO: Create a variable called player_health and set it to 100
# TODO: Print "Starting health:" and the value
# TODO: Change player_health to 75
# TODO: Print "After damage:" and the value
# TODO: Change player_health to 90
# TODO: Print "After healing:" and the value
    </div>

    <h2>4. Using Variables in Calculations</h2>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>One of the most powerful uses of variables is in calculations. You can use variables anywhere you would use a number, and you can create new variables based on existing ones.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-pdb">
        <pre><code># Basic calculations with variables
length = 10
width = 5
area = length * width

print("Length:", length)
print("Width:", width)
print("Area:", area)

# Using variables in more complex calculations
price = 29.99
tax_rate = 0.08
tax_amount = price * tax_rate
total = price + tax_amount

print("Price:", price)
print("Tax rate:", tax_rate)
print("Tax amount:", tax_amount)
print("Total:", total)

# Variables can use other variables
first_number = 15
second_number = 25
sum_result = first_number + second_number
average = sum_result / 2

print("First number:", first_number)
print("Second number:", second_number)
print("Sum:", sum_result)
print("Average:", average)</code></pre>
    </div>

    <h3>Exercise: Calculate Circle Properties</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Given a circle's radius, calculate its diameter and area. Use variables to store the radius (5), diameter (radius * 2), and area (radius * radius * 3.14159).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-exercise"
         data-expected-output="Radius: 5
Diameter: 10
Area: 78.53975"
         data-answer='radius = 5
diameter = radius * 2
area = radius * radius * 3.14159
print("Radius:", radius)
print("Diameter:", diameter)
print("Area:", area)'>
# TODO: Create a variable called radius and assign it the value 5
# TODO: Create a variable called diameter that equals radius * 2
# TODO: Create a variable called area that equals radius * radius * 3.14159
# TODO: Print all three values with appropriate labels
    </div>

    <h2>5. String Variables and Text Operations</h2>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>String variables (text) have special capabilities. You can combine them, repeat them, and perform other text operations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-pdb">
        <pre><code># Combining strings
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Smith"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

print("First name:", first_name)
print("Last name:", last_name)
print("Full name:", full_name)

# Repeating strings
star = "*"
line = star * 20
greeting = "Hello! "
repeated_greeting = greeting * 3

print("Single star:", star)
print("Line of stars:", line)
print("Single greeting:", greeting)
print("Repeated greeting:", repeated_greeting)

# Mixing strings and other operations
item = "apple"
count = 5
message = "I have " + str(count) + " " + item + "s"

print("Item:", item)
print("Count:", count)
print("Message:", message)</code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Notice that we used <code>str(count)</code> to convert the number to text before combining it with other strings. This is necessary because Python can't directly combine numbers and text with the <code>+</code> operator.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Exercise: Create a Personalized Message</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Create variables for a person's name and their age, then create a personalized birthday message that combines them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-exercise"
         data-expected-output="Happy birthday, Sarah!
You are now 25 years old.
Hope you have a wonderful day!"
         data-answer='name = "Sarah"
age = 25
message = "Happy birthday, " + name + "!"
age_message = "You are now " + str(age) + " years old."
wish = "Hope you have a wonderful day!"

print(message)
print(age_message)
print(wish)'>
# TODO: Create a variable called name and assign it "Sarah"
# TODO: Create a variable called age and assign it 25
# TODO: Create a message that says "Happy birthday, " + name + "!"
# TODO: Create an age_message that says "You are now " + age + " years old."
# TODO: Create a wish that says "Hope you have a wonderful day!"
# TODO: Print all three messages
    </div>

    <h2>6. Common Variable Mistakes</h2>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Let's look at common mistakes beginners make with variables so you can avoid them:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-pdb">
        <pre><code># Common mistakes and corrections:

# 1. Using a variable before defining it
# print(undefined_variable)  # This would cause an error

# Correct: define first, then use
my_variable = "Hello"
print(my_variable)

# 2. Forgetting quotes for text
correct_text = "This is text"
# incorrect_text = This is text  # This would cause an error

print("Correct text:", correct_text)

# 3. Using reserved words as variable names
# print = "Hello"  # This would break the print function!

# Correct: use descriptive names that aren't reserved
message = "Hello"
print("Message:", message)

# 4. Inconsistent variable names
user_name = "Alice"
# Later in code, accidentally using different name:
# print(username)  # This would cause an error (missing underscore)

print("User name:", user_name)  # Correct: match the exact name

# 5. Mixing up assignment (=) with comparison (==)
value = 10  # Assignment: store 10 in value
print("Value:", value)
# Later we'll learn about comparison: value == 10</code></pre>
    </div>

    <h3>Exercise: Fix the Variable Errors</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>The code below has several variable-related errors. Fix them so the program runs correctly and prints information about a student.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-exercise"
         data-expected-output="Student: Emma Wilson
Grade: A
Points: 95"
         data-answer='student_name = "Emma Wilson"
student_grade = "A"
points_earned = 95

print("Student:", student_name)
print("Grade:", student_grade)
print("Points:", points_earned)'>
# The code below has errors - fix them:

# TODO: Fix the variable name (should be student_name)
# studentName = "Emma Wilson"

# TODO: Fix the missing quotes around the grade
# student_grade = A

# TODO: Fix the variable name to be consistent (should be points_earned)
# pointsEarned = 95

# TODO: Fix the print statements to use correct variable names
# print("Student:", student_name)
# print("Grade:", student_grade)
# print("Points:", points_earned)
    </div>

    <div class="bring-together">
