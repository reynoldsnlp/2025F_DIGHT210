    <h1>Lesson 1a: Comments - Adding Notes to Your Code</h1>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Welcome to your first lesson about Python comments! Think of comments as sticky notes you put on your code - they help you remember what your code does and help others understand it too.</p>
        <p>In this lesson, you'll learn:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How to write single-line comments using <code>#</code></li>
            <li>How to write multi-line comments using triple quotes</li>
            <li>The important difference between how Python handles each type</li>
            <li>When and why to use comments in your code</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Single-Line Comments with #</h2>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Single-line comments start with the <code>#</code> symbol (called a "hash" or "pound" sign). Everything after the <code>#</code> on that line is completely ignored by Python - it's like the computer can't even see it!</p>
        <p>You can use single-line comments in three ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>On their own line:</strong> <code># This is a comment</code></li>
            <li><strong>At the end of a line:</strong> <code>print("Hello") # This explains the code</code></li>
            <li><strong>To temporarily disable code:</strong> <code># print("This won't run")</code></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-pdb">
        <pre><code># This is a comment on its own line
print("Hello, World!")  # This comment explains what this line does</code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>You can write anything in comments - Python completely ignores them:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-pdb">
        <pre><code># You can write anything here - Python ignores it completely
# Even if you write nonsense: aksjdlakjsd 12345 !@#$%

print("Second line")
# print("This line won't run because it's commented out")</code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Notice how Python completely skips over the commented lines! The interpreter acts like they don't exist at all.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Exercise: Your First Comments</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Add a single-line comment above the print statement that says "Display a greeting message".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-exercise"
         data-expected-output="Welcome to Python!"
         data-answer="# Display a greeting message
print(&quot;Welcome to Python!&quot;)">
# TODO: Add a comment here that says "Display a greeting message"
print("Welcome to Python!")
    </div>

    <h2>2. Multi-Line Comments with Triple Quotes</h2>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>For longer explanations, you can use triple quotes: <code>"""</code> or <code>'''</code>. These create what are technically called "multi-line strings," but when they're not assigned to a variable, they work like comments.</p>
        <p><strong>Important difference:</strong> Unlike single-line comments with <code>#</code>, Python actually <em>does</em> read and evaluate these triple-quoted strings - but since they're not stored in a variable, they just disappear after being evaluated!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-pdb">
        <pre><code>"""
This is a multi-line comment.
You can write as much as you want here.
Python will read this text, but since it's not
assigned to a variable, it just disappears.
"""

print("Hello from Python!")</code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>You can also use single quotes for multi-line comments:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-pdb">
        <pre><code>'''
You can also use single quotes for multi-line comments.
This is useful when your comment contains double quotes like "hello".
This text is also evaluated by Python but then discarded.
'''

print("Comments help make code readable!")</code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>See how Python steps through the multi-line comments? It evaluates them as strings, but since they're not saved anywhere, they have no effect on your program.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Exercise: Multi-Line Comment</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Add a multi-line comment at the top that explains what this small program does. Include at least two lines in your comment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-exercise"
         data-expected-output="Python
Programming"
         data-answer='"""
This program demonstrates printing.
It prints two words on separate lines.
"""
print("Python")
print("Programming")'>
# TODO: Add a multi-line comment here that explains what this program does
# Include at least two lines in your comment
print("Python")
print("Programming")
    </div>

    <h2>3. The Key Difference: Ignored vs. Evaluated</h2>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>This is a crucial concept to understand:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Single-line comments (#):</strong> Completely ignored by Python - never read, never evaluated</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-line comments ("""):</strong> Read and evaluated by Python as strings, but then discarded</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let's see this difference in action by looking at what happens with syntax errors:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-pdb">
        <pre><code># This is completely ignored by Python
# Even syntax errors here won't cause problems: print(hello world
# Python never even looks at this line

print("First line works fine!")</code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Multi-line comments are evaluated as strings, so they must have valid syntax:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-pdb">
        <pre><code>"""
This multi-line comment is evaluated by Python,
so it must be valid Python syntax.
But since it's just a string with no assignment,
it gets discarded after evaluation.
"""

print("Second line also works!")

# Uncomment the next line to see what happens with a syntax error:
# """
# This would cause an error: print(hello world
# """</code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>If you uncommented those last lines, you'd get a syntax error because Python tries to evaluate the multi-line string and finds invalid syntax inside it.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Exercise: Understanding the Difference</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Add both types of comments to explain what the code does. Use a single-line comment to explain the calculation and a multi-line comment to describe the overall purpose.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-exercise"
         data-expected-output="25"
         data-answer='"""
This program calculates the area of a square.
It demonstrates basic arithmetic in Python.
"""
side_length = 5
area = side_length * side_length  # Calculate area by multiplying side by itself
print(area)'>
# TODO: Add a multi-line comment explaining the overall purpose of this program
side_length = 5
# TODO: Add a single-line comment explaining the calculation below
area = side_length * side_length
print(area)
    </div>

    <h2>4. When and Why to Use Comments</h2>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Good programmers use comments to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Explain complex logic:</strong> Help future you remember what you were thinking</li>
            <li><strong>Document functions:</strong> Explain what a function does and how to use it</li>
            <li><strong>Add TODO notes:</strong> Remind yourself what still needs to be done</li>
            <li><strong>Temporarily disable code:</strong> Test different approaches without deleting code</li>
            <li><strong>Provide context:</strong> Explain why the code was written a certain way</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-pdb">
        <pre><code>"""

fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32

print("Temperature in Celsius:", celsius)
print("Temperature in Fahrenheit:", fahrenheit)

# Alternative formula (gives same result):
# fahrenheit = celsius * 1.8 + 32</code></pre>
    </div>

    <h3>Exercise: Commenting Best Practices</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Add appropriate comments to this code. Include a multi-line comment at the top describing what the program does, and single-line comments explaining the key calculations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-exercise"
         data-expected-output="Hours worked: 40
Hourly rate: $ 15
Total pay: $ 600"
         data-answer='"""

based on hours worked and hourly rate.
"""
hours = 40  # Standard work week
rate = 15  # Dollars per hour

# Calculate total pay
total_pay = hours * rate

print("Hours worked:", hours)
print("Hourly rate: $", rate)
print("Total pay: $", total_pay)'>
# TODO: Add a multi-line comment describing what this program does

hours = 40

# TODO: Add a comment explaining the calculation
total_pay = hours * rate

print("Hours worked:", hours)
print("Hourly rate: $", rate)
print("Total pay: $", total_pay)
    </div>

    <h2>5. Common Comment Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Here are some common mistakes beginners make with comments:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Over-commenting obvious things:</strong> Don't comment every single line</li>
            <li><strong>Writing comments that lie:</strong> Update comments when you change code</li>
            <li><strong>Using comments instead of clear variable names:</strong> Good names reduce need for comments</li>
            <li><strong>Mixing comment styles unnecessarily:</strong> Be consistent in your approach</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-pdb">
        <pre><code># BAD EXAMPLES - Don't do this:

x = 5  # Set x to 5 (obvious and unnecessary)
y = 10  # Set y to 10 (obvious and unnecessary)

# This calculates the area
area = x * y  # But this comment is wrong - this calculates area of rectangle!

print("Area:", area)</code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Here's how to improve those comments:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-pdb">
        <pre><code># GOOD EXAMPLES - Do this instead:

width = 5
height = 10

# Calculate area of rectangle
area = width * height

print("Area:", area)</code></pre>
    </div>
