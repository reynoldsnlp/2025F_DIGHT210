## How to Use These Lectures

Each lecture includes:

- **Interactive Examples**: Step through code line by line to see how it executes
- **Practice Exercises**: Write and test your own Python code
- **Clear Explanations**: Detailed descriptions of concepts with real-world examples

### Recommended Order

1. Start with the **Introduction** to learn how to use the interactive tools
2. Follow the lessons in **Unit 1** sequentially (1a → 1b → 1c → 1d)
3. Review the **Unit 1 Combined Reading** for a comprehensive overview

### Tips for Success

- Take your time with interactive examples - step through them multiple times
- Practice with the exercises - don't just read the solutions
- Use the "Reset" button to replay examples as many times as needed
- Experiment with variations of the code to deepen your understanding
