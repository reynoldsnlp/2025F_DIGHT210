    <h1>Lesson 1a: The Print Function - Your First Communication with Python</h1>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Welcome to your first Python lesson! The <code>print()</code> function is like a bridge between you and the computer - it's how your program can "speak" and show you information. Think of it as the computer's voice.</p>
        <p>In this lesson, you'll learn:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How to print text (strings) and numbers</li>
            <li>The difference between text and numbers in Python</li>
            <li>How to print multiple things at once</li>
            <li>Common mistakes to avoid</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Your First Print Statement</h2>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Let's start with the most basic use of <code>print()</code>. Every print statement follows this pattern:</p>
        <p><strong>print(what_you_want_to_show)</strong></p>
        <p>Notice the parentheses - they're required! Let's see it in action:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-pdb">
        <pre><code>print("Hello, World!")
print("Welcome to Python programming!")</code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Notice how each <code>print()</code> statement creates a new line. This is the default behavior - each print starts on a fresh line.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Exercise: Your First Print</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Try writing your first print statement. Print the message "Python is awesome!" exactly as shown.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-exercise"
         data-expected-output="Python is awesome!"
         data-answer='print("Python is awesome!")'>
# TODO: Print the message "Python is awesome!"
    </div>

    <h2>2. Printing Text (Strings) vs Numbers</h2>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Python treats text and numbers differently:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strings (text):</strong> Must be surrounded by quotes - either "double" or 'single'</li>
            <li><strong>Numbers:</strong> No quotes needed - just write the number</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This difference is important! Let's explore what happens with each type:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-pdb">
        <pre><code># Printing strings (text) - notice the quotes
print("This is text")
print('Single quotes work too')
print("The number 42 as text")

# Printing numbers - no quotes needed
print(42)
print(3.14)
print(-17)

# What's the difference?
print("42")    # This is text that looks like a number
print(42)      # This is actually the number 42</code></pre>
    </div>

    <h3>Exercise: Strings and Numbers</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Practice printing both strings and numbers. Print the string "Age:" and then print the number 25 on the next line.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-exercise"
         data-expected-output="Age:
25"
         data-answer='print("Age:")
print(25)'>
# TODO: Print the string "Age:"
# TODO: Print the number 25
    </div>

    <h2>3. Printing Multiple Things at Once</h2>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>One of the most useful features of <code>print()</code> is that you can print multiple things in a single statement by separating them with commas. Python automatically adds spaces between the items.</p>
        <p>Pattern: <strong>print(item1, item2, item3, ...)</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-pdb">
        <pre><code># Printing multiple items with commas
print("My name is", "Alice")
print("I am", 25, "years old")
print("Temperature:", 72, "degrees")

# Mixing strings and numbers
print("The answer is", 42)
print("Pi equals approximately", 3.14159)
print("Score:", 100, "out of", 150)</code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Notice how Python automatically puts a space between each item when you use commas. This makes it easy to build messages that combine text and numbers.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Exercise: Multiple Items</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Print the phrase "I have 3 cats and 2 dogs" using multiple arguments to print(). Break it into separate strings and numbers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-exercise"
         data-expected-output="I have 3 cats and 2 dogs"
         data-answer='print("I have", 3, "cats and", 2, "dogs")'>
# TODO: Print "I have", the number 3, "cats and", the number 2, "dogs"
# Use commas to separate the different parts
    </div>

    <h2>4. More Complex Examples</h2>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Let's see more examples of how to combine strings and numbers effectively. This is a skill you'll use constantly in Python programming.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-pdb">
        <pre><code># Creating informative messages
print("Today's date:", "January", 15, 2024)
print("Items in cart:", 7)
print("Total cost: $", 23.45)

# Multiple calculations shown
print("Length:", 10, "Width:", 5, "Area:", 10 * 5)
print("First number:", 8, "Second number:", 3, "Sum:", 8 + 3)

# Fun with formatting
print("=" * 20)  # This prints 20 equal signs
print("Welcome to our store!")
print("=" * 20)</code></pre>
    </div>

    <h3>Exercise: Restaurant Bill</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Create a restaurant bill printout. Print the meal cost ($18.50), tax ($2.22), and total ($20.72) using the format shown in the expected output.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-exercise"
         data-expected-output="Meal cost: $ 18.5
Tax: $ 2.22
Total: $ 20.72"
         data-answer='print("Meal cost: $", 18.50)
print("Tax: $", 2.22)
print("Total: $", 20.72)'>
# TODO: Print "Meal cost: $" followed by 18.50
# TODO: Print "Tax: $" followed by 2.22
# TODO: Print "Total: $" followed by 20.72
    </div>

    <h2>5. Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</h2>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Let's look at some common mistakes beginners make with the print function, so you can avoid them:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-pdb">
        <pre><code># Common mistakes (these will cause errors):

# 1. Forgetting parentheses
# print "Hello"  # This would cause an error

# 2. Forgetting quotes around text
# print(Hello)   # This would cause an error

# 3. Mixing quote types incorrectly
# print("Hello')  # This would cause an error

# Correct versions:
print("Hello")           # Correct: quotes and parentheses
print("Mixed quotes work", 'when done right')
print('You can use single quotes throughout')

# 4. Numbers don't need quotes
print(42)               # Correct: number without quotes
print("42")             # Also correct: number as text

# The difference:
print(10 + 5)           # This prints 15 (math)
print("10 + 5")         # This prints "10 + 5" (text)</code></pre>
    </div>

    <h3>Exercise: Fix the Mistakes</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>The code below has the right idea but some syntax errors. Fix it so it prints correctly. The goal is to print "Score: 95 out of 100".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-exercise"
         data-expected-output="Score: 95 out of 100"
         data-answer='print("Score:", 95, "out of", 100)'>
# This code has errors - fix them:
# print(Score:, 95, out of, 100)
# TODO: Add quotes around the text parts and fix any other issues
    </div>

    <h2>6. Building Longer Messages</h2>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>As your programs get more complex, you'll often need to print longer, more detailed messages. Here's how to handle that:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-pdb">
        <pre><code># Creating detailed output
print("Welcome to the Grade Calculator!")
print("Student:", "Sarah Johnson")
print("Course:", "Introduction to Python")
print("Assignments completed:", 8, "out of", 10)
print("Average score:", 87.5, "percent")
print("Letter grade:", "B+")
print("Congratulations on your progress!")</code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Notice how we use multiple print statements to create organized, readable output. Each print creates a new line, making the information easy to read.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Exercise: Personal Introduction</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Create a personal introduction that prints information about a fictional character. Include their name, age, favorite number, and a hobby. Use multiple print statements with mixed strings and numbers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyodide-exercise"
         data-expected-output="Name: Alex Rodriguez
Age: 22
Favorite number: 7
Hobby: photography
Fun fact: I have visited 15 countries!"
         data-answer='print("Name: Alex Rodriguez")
print("Age:", 22)
print("Favorite number:", 7)
print("Hobby: photography")
print("Fun fact: I have visited", 15, "countries!")'>
# TODO: Print "Name: Alex Rodriguez"
# TODO: Print "Age:" followed by the number 22
# TODO: Print "Favorite number:" followed by the number 7
# TODO: Print "Hobby: photography"
# TODO: Print "Fun fact: I have visited" followed by 15 followed by "countries!"
    </div>
